# aidev-ide Release Notes

This document contains the complete release history for aidev-ide VSCode extension.

## Version 3.0.0 (2025/10/04) - Terminal Daemon, Send Queue, Error‑first Automation

</details>


<details>
<summary>Output Sanitization & Error Monitoring</summary>

- Stripped ANSI/PTY control sequences from logs for clean rendering
- Expanded error pattern detection: `npm error`, `Missing script:`, `Exit status X`, `Process exited (code X)`
- Errors are auto-forwarded to chat and used to trigger LLM-based remediation (with an 8s cooldown to avoid loops)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Context Gathering Improvements (Node.js)</summary>

- `package.json` is always included first in prompt context for Node.js projects
- For Node frontend stacks (React/Vue/Angular/Svelte/Next/Nuxt/Vite/Webpack), search scope limited to `package.json` and `src/**`, explicitly excluding `node_modules/`
- Logged searched file list to debug console for transparency

</details>

<details>
<summary>Chat Send Queue & Pending UI</summary>
